ZimHUD Version 1.0

-----------------
ISSUES
-----------------

There are bound to be issues with this HUD as it is an initial release. Please let
me know about them either on the TF.tv thread or on the Git tracker.

-----------------
4x3 RESOLUTIONS
-----------------

Use the 4x3 overrides provided in the folder. Copy and paste them in to resource/ui.

-----------------
CUSTOMIZATION
-----------------

This HUD was created with customization in mind. For more information, read the instructions in the ClientScheme.

-----------------
NOTES
-----------------

MVM is not customized yet! I will get to it when I have the time, but I figured holding onto a perfectly
functional HUD just to work on MVM is not fair to you guys.

The custom control points do NOT work in sv_pure 2 (yet). I am still working on a way to have them
work across all servers if possible. Sorry!
